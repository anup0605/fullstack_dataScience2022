1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
'hello';
-87.8
-
/
+
6
Ans:
   @)Values-     6(integer),-87.8(float)
     Expression-  *,-,/,+
     string- 'hello'

2.What is the difference between string and variable?

   @)Strings are tha data,we can use as variable.variable can store the data in a program.

3.Describe three different data types.
  @)normally two types -
         fundamental(int,float,str,complex,bool)=5
         collection(list,tuple,range,dict,set,frozenset,byte,bytearray & none)=9
   
@according to categories:

   text type - str
   Numeric   - int,float,complex
   Sequence  - list,tuple,range
   Mapping   - dict
   Set       - set,frozenset
   Boolean   - bool
   Binary    -bytes,bytesarray
   None      -None

4.What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

  @)An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations.  
      which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.
5.  This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

  @)Expression is made up of values,containers & mathemetical operands & statement is just like a command that a pythonminterpreter execute like print.

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
  @)bacon=23

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
"39" + "spamspam";
'spam' * 3
  @)>>> 39spamspam
   >>>  spamspamspam

8.Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
   @)Variable names cannot begin with a number.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
    @)int(),float() & str()

10.Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
      'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.';
   @)99 is an integer & only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator.
